Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.","comments":"There can be no stigma associated with the use of extensions by any application, project, or standard - regardless of the institution or jurisdiction that uses or defines the extensions.  The use of extensions is what allows the FHIR specification to retain a core level of simplicity for everyone.","alias":["extensions","user content","modifiers"],"min":0,"max":"*","base":{"path":"Procedure.focalDevice.modifierExtension","min":0,"max":"*"},"type":[{"code":"Extension"}],"isModifier":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":"N/A"}]},{"id":"Procedure:argoprofile.focalDevice.action","path":"Procedure.focalDevice.action","short":"Kind of change to device","definition":"The kind of change that happened to the device during the procedure.","min":0,"max":"1","base":{"path":"Procedure.focalDevice.action","min":0,"max":"1"},"type":[{"code":"CodeableConcept"}],"binding":{"strength":"required","description":"A kind of change that happened to the device during the procedure.","valueSetReference":{"reference":"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/device-action"}}},{"id":"Procedure:argoprofile.focalDevice.manipulated","path":"Procedure.focalDevice.manipulated","short":"Device that was changed","definition":"The device that was manipulated (changed) during the procedure.","min":1,"max":"1","base":{"path":"Procedure.focalDevice.manipulated","min":1,"max":"1"},"type":[{"code":"Reference","targetProfile":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Device"}]},{"id":"Procedure:argoprofile.used","path":"Procedure.used","short":"Items used during procedure","definition":"Identifies medications, devices and any other substance used as part of the procedure.","comments":"For devices actually implanted or removed, use Procedure.device.","requirements":"Used for tracking contamination, etc.","min":0,"max":"*","base":{"path":"Procedure.used","min":0,"max":"*"},"type":[{"code":"Reference","targetProfile":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Device"},{"code":"Reference","targetProfile":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Medication"},{"code":"Reference","targetProfile":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Substance"}]}]},"differential":{"element":[{"id":"Procedure:argoprofile","path":"Procedure","sliceName":"argoprofile","short":"Argonaut Procedure Profile","mustSupport":false,"isModifier":false,"isSummary":false},{"id":"Procedure:argoprofile.subject","path":"Procedure.subject","min":1,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"Reference","targetProfile":"http://fhir.org/guides/argonaut/StructureDefinition/argo-patient"}],"mustSupport":true,"isModifier":false,"isSummary":false},{"id":"Procedure:argoprofile.status","path":"Procedure.status","min":1,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"code"}],"mustSupport":true,"isModifier":false,"isSummary":false,"binding":{"strength":"required","valueSetReference":{"reference":"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/procedure-status"}}},{"id":"Procedure:argoprofile.code","path":"Procedure.code","short":"SNOMED-CT | ICD-10 | CPT-4","min":1,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"CodeableConcept"}],"mustSupport":true,"isModifier":false,"isSummary":false,"binding":{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet","valueReference":{"reference":"http://fhir.org/guides/argonaut/ValueSet/procedure-type"}}],"strength":"extensible","description":"Codes describing the Procedure Type","valueSetReference":{"reference":"http://fhir.org/guides/argonaut/ValueSet/procedure-type"}}},{"id":"Procedure:argoprofile.performed[x]","path":"Procedure.performed[x]","min":1,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"dateTime"},{"code":"Period"}],"mustSupport":true,"isModifier":false,"isSummary":false}]}}
