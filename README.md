# Inferno Program Edition

## ONC 21st Century Cures open API certification Testing

**Inferno Program Edition** performs API conformance testing for the [Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to Improve the Interoperability of Health
Information](https://www.healthit.gov/topic/laws-regulation-and-policy/notice-proposed-rulemaking-improve-interoperability-health).
It implements the test steps described in the [NPRM draft test method for
170.315(g)(10) Standardized API for patient and population
services](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page/2019-03/170_315g_10_Standardized_API_for_Patient_and_Population_Services.pdf).
This application can be [installed locally](#installation-and-deployment), and a
public reference instance of this application can be accessed at
[https://inferno.healthit.gov/inferno](https://inferno.healthit.gov/inferno).

**Inferno Program Edition** is a pre-configured and customized version of the
open source [Inferno](https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno-program) FHIR
testing tool, and only contains tests and functionality relevant to the ONC
Certification Program.  Users interested in extending or reusing this open
testing capability to meet their own needs are encouraged to visit the [Inferno
GitHub repository](https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno).


**Inferno Program Edition** currently tests conformance to the following
standards as described in the proposed rule:
* FHIR DSTU2 and Argonaut Data Query Implementation Guide v1
* FHIR R4 and US Core R4 (an alternative to DSTU2 for comment)
* SMART on FHIR App Launch Guide v1

Prior to final release of the rule, these tests are considered draft and are
subject to change.  Users are encouraged to [provide feedback](#contact-us)
regarding these tests to ensure they are complete and accurately reflect the
requirements of these sets of standards.

## Installation and Deployment

### Docker Installation

Docker is the recommended installation method for Windows devices and can also
be used on Linux and MacOS hosts.

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for the host platform as well as
   the [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) tool (which
   may be included in the distribution, as is the case for Windows and MacOS).
2. Download the [latest release of the `inferno`
   project](https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno/releases) to your local
   computer on a directory of your choice.
3. Open a terminal in the directory where the project was downloaded (above).
4. Run the command `docker-compose up` to start the server. This will
   automatically build the Docker image and launch both the ruby server (using
   unicorn) and an NGINX web server.
5. Navigate to http://localhost:4567 to find the running application.

If the docker image gets out of sync with the underlying system, such as when
new dependencies are added to the application, you need to run `docker-compose
up --build` to rebuild the containers.

Check out the [Troubleshooting
Documentation](https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno/wiki/Troubleshooting) for
help.

### Native Installation

Inferno can installed and run locally on your machine.  Install the following
dependencies first:

* [Ruby 2.5+](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
* [Ruby Bundler](http://bundler.io/)
* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)

And run the following commands from the terminal:

```sh
# MacOS or Linux
git clone https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno
cd inferno
bundle install
bundle exec rackup
```

Inferno can then be accessed at http://localhost:4567 in a web browser.

If you would like to use a different port it can be specified when calling
`rackup`.  For example, the following command would host Inferno on port 3000:

```sh
rackup -p 3000
```

### Remote Deployment

Inferno can also be deployed onto a server to test many different instances of
the FHIR Servers by multiple users.  Test results are kept private at a unique,
unguessable URI that can be saved for future reference or shared.

Deployment on a remote server can be done by using a modified form of the Docker
containers provided (see above) or by direct installation on the remote host.

Please see the file
[deployment-configuration.md](https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno-program/blob/master/deployment-configuration.md)
for details.

### Terminology Support
In order to validate terminologies, Inferno must be loaded with files generated from the 
Unified Medical Language System (UMLS).  The UMLS is distributed by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) and requires an account to access.

Inferno provides some rake tasks which may make this process easier, as well as a Dockerfile and docker-compose file that will create the validators in a self-contained environment.

Prerequisites:
* A UMLS account
* A working Docker toolchain, which has been assigned at least 10GB of RAM (The Metathesaurus step requires 8GB of RAM for the Java process)
* A copy of the Inferno repository, which contains the required Docker and Ruby files

You can prebuild the terminology docker container by running the following command:
```sh
docker-compose -f terminology_compose.yml build
```
Once the container is built, you can run the terminology creation task by using the following commands, in order:
```sh
export UMLS_USERNAME=<your UMLS username>
export UMLS_PASSWORD=<your UMLS password>
docker-compose -f terminology_compose.yml up
```
This will run the terminology creation steps in order, using the UMLS credentials supplied. These tasks may take several hours. If the creation task is cancelled in progress and restarted, it will restart after the last _completed_ step. Intermediate files are saved to `tmp/terminology` in the Inferno repository that the Docker Compose job is run from, and the validators are saved to `resources/terminology/validators/bloom`, where Inferno can use them for validation.

If this Docker-based method does not work based on your architecture, manual setup and creation of the terminology validators is documented [on this wiki page](https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno/wiki/Installing-Terminology-Validators#building-the-validators-without-docker)

### Reference Implementation

While it is recommended that users install Inferno locally, a reference
implementation of Inferno is hosted at https://inferno.healthit.gov

Users that would like to try out Inferno before installing locally can use that
reference implementation, but should be forewarned that the database will be
periodically refreshed and there is no guarantee that previous test runs will be
available in perpetuity.

## Supported Browsers

Inferno has been tested on the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and
Edge.  Internet Explorer is not supported at this time.

## Unit Tests

Inferno contains a robust set of self-tests to ensure that the test clients
conform to the specification and performs as intended.  To run these tests,
execute the following command:

```sh
bundle exec rake test
```

## Inspecting and Exporting Tests

Tests are written to be easily understood, even by those who aren't familiar
with Ruby.  They can be viewed directly [in this
repository](https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno/tree/master/lib/app/modules).

Tests contain metadata that provide additional details and traceability to
standards.  The active tests and related metadata can be exported into CSV
format and saved to a file named `testlist.csv` with the following command:

```sh
bundle exec rake inferno:tests_to_csv
```

Arguments can be provided to the task in order to export a specific set of tests
or to specify the output file.

```sh
bundle exec rake inferno:tests_to_csv[onc,all_tests.csv]
```

To just choose the module and use the default groups and filename:

```sh
bundle exec rake inferno:tests_to_csv[onc]

```

## Running Tests from the Command Line
Inferno provides two methods of running tests via the command line: by directly
providing the sequences or running automated scripts

_Note: This feature is still in development and we are looking for feedback on
features and improvements in ways it can be used_

### Running Tests Directly

Testing sequences can be run from the command line via a rake task which takes
the sequence (or sequences) to be run and server url as arguments:
```sh
bundle exec rake inferno:execute[https://my-server.org/data,onc,ArgonautConformance]
```

### Running Automated Command Line Interface Scripts
For more complicated testing where passing arguments is unwieldy, Inferno
provides the ability to use a script containing parameters to drive test
execution. The provided `example_script.json` shows an example of this script
and how it can be used.  The `execute_batch` task runs the script:

```sh
bundle exec rake inferno:execute_batch[script.json]
```

Inferno also provides a  `generate_script` rake task which prompts the user for
a series of inputs which are then used to generate a script. The user is
expected to provide a url for the FHIR Server to be tested and the module name
from which sequences will be pulled.
```sh
bundle exec rake inferno:generate_script[https://my-server.org/data,onc]
```

### Caveats
* For `DynamicRegistration` users must provide instructions similar to that
  provided in `example_script.json` to automate the webdriver.
* The `confidential_client` field is a boolean and must be provided as `true` or
  `false`

## Using with Continuous Integration Systems
Instructions and examples are available in the [Continuous Integration Section
of the
Wiki](https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno/wiki/Using-with-Continuous-Integration-Systems).
