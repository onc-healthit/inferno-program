    <p>
    Inferno Program Edition is a streamlined testing tool for  Health
    Level 7 (HL7®) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) services seeking to meet
    the requirements of the Standardized API for Patient and Population Services criterion § 170.315(g)(10) in the 2015 Edition Cures Update.
    </p>
    <p>
    Inferno behaves like an API consumer, making a series of HTTP requests that mimic a real world client to ensure that the API
    supports all required standards, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>FHIR Release 4.0.1</li>
    <li>FHIR US Core Implementation Guide (IG)
    STU 3.1.0</li>
    <li>SMART Application Launch Framework Implementation Guide Release 1.0.0</li>
    <li>HL7 FHIR Bulk Data Access (Flat FHIR) (v1.0.0: STU 1) </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Inferno is open source and freely available for use or adoption by the health IT community
    including EHR vendors, health app developers, and testing labs. It can be used as a testing tool
    for the EHR Certification program supported by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC).
    </p>

    <p>
    To get started, enter the endpoint of the FHIR service.  Inferno Program Edition is only intended to be
    used on test systems that do not contain PHI.
    </p>
  
  </div>

  <div class="tab-pane" style="font-size: 20px;" id="pills-data" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-data-tab">
    <div style="padding: 15px 0; font-size: 30px;">Sample Test Data</div>
    <p>
    Inferno does not currently require a specific set of data to be entered into the system under test prior to testing.
    Instead, it leverages FHIR's built-in conformance rules to ensure that data returned
    is valid FHIR, conforms to required profiles, and contains all elements that must be supported. This allows
    systems to use test data that is relevant to their intended uses.
    </p>

    <p>
If needed, Inferno supplies multiple synthetic data sets suitable for testing. These data sets are ideal for testing
because they provide coverage of all US Core profiles and support for all MUST SUPPORT data elements without
requiring a large set of patients or sacrificing realism.
</p>
<p>
Use of these data sets is optional.
</p>
<p>
The synthetic data sets are available for download in compressed archives at <a href="https://github.com/inferno-community/uscore-data-sets">Inferno US Core Data Sets</a>.
</p>
<p>
There are three data sets available:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Single patient</b> with all US Core profiled resources and USCDI elements</li>
  <li><b>Small population</b>, handful of patients covering all US Core profiles and USCDI elements</li>
  <li><b>Large population</b>, hundreds of patients covering all US Core profiles and USCDI elements</li>
</ul>
<p>
Each data set is available as FHIR JSON Transaction Bundles and FHIR Bulk Data format.
</p>
<p>
Additional data sets can be generated using the open-source <a href="https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea">Synthea<sup>TM</sup></a> tool and the <a href="https://github.com/inferno-community/uscore-data-script">Inferno US Core Data Script</a>.

    <p>
    ONC provides a demonstration instance of Inferno Program Edition at <a href="https://inferno.healthit.gov/inferno">https://inferno.healthit.gov/inferno</a>.
    However, Inferno is intended to be downloaded and run locally.
    </p>

    <p>
Docker is the recommended installation method for Windows devices and can also be used on Linux and MacOS hosts.
</p>
<p>
Install <a href="http://www.docker.com">Docker</a> for the host platform as well as the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">docker-compose tool</a> (which may be included in the distribution, as is the case for Windows and MacOS).
</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno-program/releases">Download the latest release</a> of the inferno project to your local computer on a directory of your choice.
<li>Open a terminal in the directory where the project was downloaded (above).
<li>Run the command docker-compose up to start the server. This will automatically build the Docker image and launch both the ruby server (using unicorn) and an NGINX web server.
<li>Navigate to http://localhost:4567 to find the running application.
</ol>

<p>
If the docker image gets out of sync with the underlying system, such as when new dependencies are added to the application, you need to run docker-compose up --build to rebuild the containers.
</p>

      <p>
      The Inferno Program Edition v1.3.0 minor release provides the following test updates that may
      alter the result of systems that were able to pass prior versions of these tests:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>
        Systems must demonstrate the ability to populate choice type elements within US Core Profiles flagged as 'must support' with every US Core choice type 
        listed for that choice element, unless the Profile flags one or more of the choices type of that element specifically as 'must support'. Previous versions of tests considered
        populating the choice type element with any valid choice type as sufficient evidence that the system supports that choice type element.
        </li>
      <li>Reference resolution tests were updated to verify that references to resources resolve to the correct FHIR type.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Additionally, the following updates were made which make tests less restrictive or do not affect the outcome of tests:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>Fixed issue where tests did not properly save US Core references for the Encounter, Organization and Practitioner resources in certain cases.</li>
      <li>Updated the Inferno configuration file (config.yml) to provide more descriptive detail on the various configuration parameters of Inferno.</li>
      <li>For profiles that do not allow searching only by Patient ID and require at least one other field, tests now are more thorough in crafting queries that retrieve all resources for that profile.  This is important to ensure that all available resources are used to verify all 'must support' elements.</li>
      <li>Fixes to presets for the Inferno FHIR Reference Server.</li>
      </ul>

    <div style="padding: 0 0 15px 0; font-size: 24px;">Inferno Program Edition v1.2.0</div>
      <p>
      The Inferno Program Edition v1.2.0 minor release provides the following test updates that may
      alter the result of systems that were able to pass prior versions of these tests:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>Elements of any type within US Core Profiles flagged as 'must support' must contain a value in at least one resource returned in order to qualify as being 'populated'. In certain cases in previous versions, elements containing only a 'Data Absent Reason' qualified as being 'populated'.  Tests were updated to no longer allow 'Data Absent Reason' as proof of the ability to populate an element.</li>
      <li>Systems must demonstrate the ability to populate reference type elements within US Core Profiles flagged as 'must support' with every US Core reference type listed for that reference element. Previous versions of tests considered populating the reference element with any valid reference as sufficient evidence that the system supports that reference element.</li>
      <li>Improved consistency of data validation between the Single Patient API and Multi-Patient API tests.  This includes the addition of two tests that validate PractitionerRole and RelatedPerson resources, if provided as standalone resources.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Additionally, the following updates were made which should not affect the outcome of tests:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>Removed total number of references encountered during testing in final report because it was not accurate in all cases.</li>
      <li>Fixed error in the default scopes that were pre-filled in the Multi-Patient API tests.</li>
      <li>Updated internal mapping to the official ONC Test Procedure v1.1.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      The Inferno Program Edition v1.1.0 minor release provides the following test updates that may
      alter the result of systems that were able to pass prior versions of these tests:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>Refined behavior of the Resource Access Verification AVR-01 and AVU-01 tests that are performed after the Single Patient SMART launches to ensure that scopes granted by the system under test are consistent with the expectations of test. </li>
      <li>Added visual inspection steps ATT-11, ATT-12, and ATT-13 to ensure that the Patient Demographics Suffix, Patient Demographics Previous Name, and Allergy and Intolerances Reaction USCDI v1 elements are supported by the system under test. These elements are required within USCDI but are not flagged as "must support" in US Core v3.1, so they must be manually checked during testing. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> Additionally, the following updates were made which fixed issues preventing correct implementations
      from passing prior versions:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>Fixed issue where resources using primitive extensions was incorrectly failing validation in certain cases.</li>
      <li>Fixed issue where warnings were incorrectly raised for codes that were not in ValueSets but were in CodeSystems.</li>
      <li>Removed warnings in SMART Discovery tests when optional SMART on FHIR capability metadata was not provided.</li>
      <li>Removed validation errors resulting from canonical FHIR URLs not resolving.</li>
      <li>Removed incorrect CapabilityStatement validation errors for the SMART revoke and introspect extensions.</li>

      <p>
      The Inferno Program Edition v1.0.2 patch release reverts an unintended change in testing behavior
      introduced in the previous release. US Core date searches based on period values were updated in v1.0.1 to correctly formulate search queries
      based on resources with periods that start and end on the same day.  This change inadvertently altered how tests formulate date comparator
      search queries, which may result in systems failing tests that previously passed.
      </p>
      <p>
      This update should only alter results for servers that fail search tests in v1.0.1.

      <p>
        Test updates from the previous version include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Allow response code of 403 (Forbidden) when the resource being accessed is not authorized by the user.  Previously these tests only allowed 401 (Unauthorized) to be returned, but 403 may be more suitable in this situation where valid credentials are provided but do not provide sufficient scope for the request.  <a href="https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno-program/pull/129" target="_blank">#129</a> </li>
        <li>Remove 'strict subset' requirement for granted scopes, and allow the authorization service to grant different scopes than were requested by the app.  <a href="https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno-program/pull/132" target="_blank">#132</a>  </li>
        <li>Change failure to demonstrate all MUST SUPPORT elements in the multi-patient API from FAIL to SKIP to be consistent with single-patient API test behavior.  <a href="https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno-program/pull/123" target="_blank">#123</a>  </li>
        <li>Change search comparator behavior for dates so that the date range search is more broad to ensure timezone offsets do not cause known dates to not fall within the search query.  <a href="https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno-program/pull/121" target="_blank">#121</a>  </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Additionally, the following updates have been made to the Inferno UI, installation, and deployment configuration:
