        # Background

        The US Core #{title} sequence verifies that the system under test is able to provide correct responses
        for Location queries.  These queries must contain resources conforming to US Core Location Profile as specified
        in the US Core v3.1.0 Implementation Guide.

        # Testing Methodology


        Because Location resources are not required by USCDI, no searches are performed on this test sequence. Instead, references to
        this profile found in other resources are used for testing. If no references can be found this way, then all the tests
        in this sequence are skipped.


        ## Must Support
        Each profile has a list of elements marked as "must support". This test sequence expects to see each of these elements
        at least once. If at least one cannot be found, the test will fail. The test will look through the Location
        resources found for these elements.

        ## Profile Validation
        Each resource returned from the first search is expected to conform to the [US Core Location Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-location).
        Each element is checked against teminology binding and cardinality requirements.

        Elements with a required binding is validated against its bound valueset. If the code/system in the element is not part
        of the valueset, then the test will fail.

        ## Reference Validation
        Each reference within the resources found from the first search must resolve. The test will attempt to read each reference found
        and will fail if any attempted read fails.
