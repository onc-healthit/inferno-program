          This includes all FHIR endpoints (if more than one is provided), as

          configured to disable TLS testing if configuring TLS within a
          lab environment is not possible.  Note that there are no SHALL
          requirements within the "FHIR Communications Security Requirements" in
          FHIR R4, and therefore there are no tests based on this requirement.

          more than what was pre-authorized.  The Health IT module must
          demonstrate this and register its attestation within Inferno.

          The requirement "all information is accurate and without omission"
          cannot be verified automatically by Inferno, as Inferno only has
          visibility into the data being returned in the API.  Inferno also does
          not require a specific set of data to be loaded.  Because of this,
          omissions are not possible to detect.  However, the tester can use the
          tool to compare responses to what is displayed in the system, and
          register this as an attestation.  Additionally, US Core v3.1 does
          not include three required USCDI v1 data elements for Patient Demographics
          and Allergy and Intolerances, and this requires visual inspection
