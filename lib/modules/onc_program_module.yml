      - name: Standalone Patient App
        overview: |
          Demonstrate the ability to perform a Patient Standalone Launch to a [SMART on FHIR](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/) client with a patient context,
          refresh token, and [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) identity token.  After launch, a simple Patient resource read is performed
          on the patient in context.  The access token is then refreshed, and the Patient resource is read using the new
          access token to ensure that the refresh was successful.  Finally, the authentication information provided by OpenID Connect is decoded and validated.
        input_instructions: |
          Enter in the appropriate scope to enable patient-level access to all relevant resources.  In addition, support for the 
          OpenID Connect (`openid fhirUser`), refresh tokens (`offline_access`), and patient context (`launch/patient`) are required.

        overview: |
          Demonstrate the ability to perform an EHR launch to a [SMART on FHIR](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/) client with a patient context,
          refresh token, and [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) identity token.  After launch, a simple Patient resource read is performed

          OpenID Connect (`openid fhirUser`), refresh tokens (`offline_access`), and EHR context (`launch`) are required.  This test
          expects that the EHR will launch the application with a patient context.

          After `execute` is pressed, Inferno will wait for the system under test to launch the application.

        overview: >
          For each of the relevant USCDI data elements provided in the conformance statement, this test executes the [required supported searches](http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/Conformance-server.html)
          as defined by the Argonaut Data Query Implementation Guide.  The test begins by searching by Patient provided in the most recent SMART App Launch performed by Inferno.  It uses results returned from that
          query to generate other queries and checks that the results are consistent with the provided search parameters.  It then performs a read on each Resource returned and validates the response against the 
          relevant [profile](http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/profiles.html) as currently defined in the Argonaut Data Query Implementation Guide.

        overview: >
          Demonstrate the ability to export clinical data for multiple patients in a group using [FHIR Bulk Data Access IG](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/). This test uses 
          [Backend Services Authorization](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/authorization/index.html) to obtain an access token from the server. After authorization, a group level bulk data export 
          request is initialized. Finally, this test reads exported NDJSON files from the server and validates the resources in each file. To run the test successfully, the selected group export is required
          to have every type of resource mapped to [USCDI data elements](https://www.healthit.gov/isa/us-core-data-interoperability-uscdi).
        input_instructions: |
          Register Inferno as a bulk data client with the following information, and enter the client id and client registration in the appropriate fields.
          This set of tests only checks the Group export.  Enter the group export information in the appropriate box.
