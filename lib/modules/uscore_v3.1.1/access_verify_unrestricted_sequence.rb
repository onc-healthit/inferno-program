      description 'Verify that patients can grant access to all necessary resource types.'
      test_id_prefix 'AVU'
      details %(
        This test ensures that apps have full access to USCDI resources if granted access by the tester.
        The tester must grant access to the following resources during the SMART Launch process,
        and this test ensures they all can be accessed:

          * AllergyIntolerance
          * CarePlan
          * CareTeam
          * Condition
          * Device
          * DiagnosticReport
          * DocumentReference
          * Goal
          * Immunization
          * MedicationRequest
          * Observation
          * Procedure
          * Patient
          * Provenance
          * Encounter
          * Practitioner
          * Organization

        For each of the resource types that can be mapped to USCDI data class or elements, this set of tests
        performs a minimum number of requests to determine that the resource type can be accessed given the
        scope granted.  In the case of the Patient resource, this test simply performs a read request.
        For other resources, it performs a search by patient that must be supported by the server.  In some cases,
        servers can return an error message if a status search parameter is not provided.  For these, the
        test will perform an additional search with the required status search parameter.

        This set of tests does not attempt to access resources that do not directly map to USCDI v1, including Encounter, Location,
        Organization, Practitioner, PractionerRole, and RelatedPerson.  It also does not test Provenance, as this
        resource type is accessed by queries through other resource types. These resources types are accessed in the more
        comprehensive Single Patient Query tests.

        However, the authorization system must indicate that access is granted to the Encounter, Practitioner and Organization
        resource types by providing them in the returned scopes because they are required to support the read interaction.
